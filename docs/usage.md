Usage
=====

contour-plus is an add-on controller for [Contour][]'s [IngressRoute][].

It helps integration of Contour with [external-dns][] and [cert-manager][].

Command-line flags and environment variables
--------------------------------------------

contour-plus takes following command-line flags or environment variables.
If both is specified, command-line flags take precedence.

| Flag                  | Envvar                   | Default                   | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metrics-addr`        | `CP_METRICS_ADDR`        | :8080                     | Bind address for the metrics endpoint                         |
| `crds`                | `CP_CRDS`                | `DNSEndpoint,Certificate` | Comma-separated list of CRDs to be created                    |
| `name-prefix`         | `CP_NAME_PREFIX`         | ""                        | Prefix of CRD names to be created                             |
| `service-name`        | `CP_SERVICE_NAME`        | ""                        | NamespacedName of the Contour LoadBalancer Service (required) |
| `default-issuer-name` | `CP_DEFAULT_ISSUER_NAME` | ""                        | Issuer name used by default                                   |
| `default-issuer-kind` | `CP_DEFAULT_ISSUER_KIND` | `ClusterIssuer`           | Issuer kind used by default                                   |

By default, contour-plus creates [DNSEndpoint][] when `spec.virtualhost.fqdn` of an IngressRoute is not empty,
and creates [Certificate][] when `spec.virtualhost.tls.secretName` is not empty and not namespaced.

To disable CRD creation, specify `crds` command-line flag or `CP_CRDS` environment variable.

`service-name` is a required flag/envvar that must be the namespaced name of Service for Contour.
In a normal setup, Contour has a `type=LoadBalancer` Service to expose its Envoy pods to Internet.
By specifying `service-name`, contour-plus can identify the global IP address for FQDNs in IngressRoute.

How it works
------------

contour-plus should be deployed with Deployment.  It monitors events for [IngressRoute][] and
creates / updates / deletes [DNSEndpoint][] and/or [Certificate][].

### Supported annotations

You can specify the following annotations on IngressRoute in order to trigger CRD resources to be automatically created.

- `contour-plus.cybozu.com/exclude: "true"` - If this annotation is annotated, contour-plus does not generate CRD resources from the IngressRoute.
- `certmanager.k8s.io/issuer` - The name of an  [Issuer][] to acquire the certificate required for this Ingressroute from. The Issuer must be in the same namespace as the IngressRoute.
- `certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer` - The name of a [ClusterIssuer][Issuer] to acquire the certificate required for this ingress from. It does not matter which namespace your Ingress resides, as ClusterIssuers are non-namespaced resources.
- `kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` - If this annotation is annotated, contour-plus generate Certificate automatically from IngressRoute.

If both of `certmanager.k8s.io/issuer` and `certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer` exist, `cluster-issuer` takes precedence.
